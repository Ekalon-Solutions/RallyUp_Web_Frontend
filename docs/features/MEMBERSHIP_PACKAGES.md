## User Workflows

## Technical Architecture

### Authentication & Authorization

- Admin or Super Admin role required for plan creation/modification
- Regular users can browse and select plans
- JWT-based authentication throughout
- Proper error handling and validation

### Data Flow

1. **Plan Creation:** Admin → API → MongoDB → Real-time UI updates
2. **Plan Selection:** User → API → UserMembership creation → Confirmation
3. **Plan Display:** Database → API → Frontend with proper formatting

### Error Handling

- Comprehensive error messages for all operations
- Loading states during API calls
- Toast notifications for user feedback
- Validation on both frontend and backend

### Performance Considerations

- Indexed MongoDB queries for efficient plan retrieval
- Optimistic UI updates where appropriate
- Lazy loading and pagination ready for large plan catalogs
- Caching-friendly API responses
