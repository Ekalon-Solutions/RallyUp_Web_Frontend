    console.log("Member was added successfully!")
    // Refresh member list, show success message, etc.

```tsx
<AddMemberModal 
  trigger={
    <Button variant="outline" size="lg">

      Create New Member
    </Button>
  }
  onMemberAdded={() => {
    // Custom callback logic
  }}
/>
```

## API Integration

### User Creation
The modal uses the existing `/api/users/register` endpoint to create new users with all required fields.

### Membership Assignment
After user creation, it automatically creates a user membership using `/api/user-memberships` endpoint.

### Required Backend Endpoints
- `POST /api/users/register` - User creation
- `POST /api/user-memberships` - Membership assignment
- `GET /api/membership-plans?clubId={clubId}` - Fetch club plans

## Data Flow

1. **User Input** â†’ Form validation â†’ User creation API call
2. **User Created** â†’ Get user ID â†’ Membership plan selection
3. **Plan Selected** â†’ Payment method selection (if paid plan)
